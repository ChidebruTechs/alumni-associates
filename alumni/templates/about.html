                    <li><h5>Networking</h5></li>
                    <p>Being a part of an Alumni association can open many doors for you and allow you to reap a lot of different benefits as it brings together like-minded individuals.  One of the main purposes of alumni associations is to support a network of former graduates who will, in turn, help to raise the profile of the institution. Networking is on one of such benefits.  alumni programs are open to all former students and offer a broader networking scope. It  provides serious engagement platform through its social and  professional networks.  Not only does it give the opportunity to stay engaged, but it also allows you to help new members.  An alumni network connects you, with a number of professional contacts and other graduates from your university/institution/school.  Your alumni are your international ambassadors.
                         can spread word-of-mouth marketing among their  contacts to countries and into their professional and s networks</p>
                    <li><h5>Career Development</h5></li>
                    <p>      alumni often participate in and benefit from career insights and advice from other alumni and career professionals with the university.            Alumni are great role models for current students and are often well placed to offer practical support to students as they start their careers           
                        Your priority is to understand your starting position. Unless you know your starting point, you will find it difficult to set goals and to develop an action plan for future success. It is important to acknowledge what has worked – to build off of these achievements and foster morale with your new colleagues. One of the things to remember about alumni associations is that they want you to succeed. Of course, they're hoping that you'll use your success to help the association and university, but successful graduates are a university's best asset. It's no surprise then that most alumni associations offer a variety of career services. These can be anything from the aforementioned job fairs to things like resume workshops, job postings, and online resources for job-seekers. And most of these services are offered free of charge to alumni members. Remember the mentor programs we mentioned? These can be great tools for building your career or finding ways to maximize your earning potential.   
                        If you're heading to graduation in a couple of months or have just finished your degree, joining your school's alumni association is a good way to get a foot (or three) in the door. Contact your alumni association to see what sort of networking opportunities they offer. Some school's host job fairs. Others have mentor programs for graduates that pair outgoing students with alumni in similar career fields. And remember that with alumni associations, quality can definitely trump quantity. In fact, many small, private liberal arts colleges have some of the most active and effective alumni associations.       Whether it be building your brand, creating business connections or getting involved in other organizations, an alumni network is an excellent source for building those long-term relationships to get a foot in the door or advance your career. “I have had the best conversations with alumni that have helped me talk through career moves, life changes and so much more," said Fashion Merchandising alumna Elizabeth Keaton ’15. "My connection with alumni has helped me get closer with professional connections with companies I have dreamt of working for as well as helped me plan for future moves financially.”</p>
                    <li><h5>Job Opportunities</h5></li>
                    <p>“Being a good alum and mentor to others starts with being sure you are focused on the needs of others in matching your time and expectations for involvement," Durette said. "Being willing to share the lessons learned on your journey, strategies for meeting challenges, finding opportunities for growth and connection are a few good ways.         “I have been given such great opportunities through extracurricular work and job opportunities from alumni that without their support, attaining my higher education would have been very difficult,” said Keaton. </p>
                    <li><h5>Resource Mobilization</h5></li>
                    <p>Alumni are fundraising prospects     
                        Good alumni relations benefits alumni as well as the institution. If you support your alumni in their professional and personal lives through activities such as the facilitation of social and professional networks, preferential access to on-campus expertise and facilities and negotiated benefits with third-party suppliers, they are likely to be your loyal life-long supporters. Your support may also help your alumni achieve positions of success and influence, which will in turn benefit your institution as they begin to give back.                     Many associations host special alumni social events, and others give members free tickets to university sporting events, life-time email services, insurance and banking services, and, of course, discounts. You might expect that alumni would get discounted university merchandise, but alumni associations often offer discounts on other things like hotels, rental cars, restaurants, and other services around the world. 
                        By helping the institution become bigger, stronger and more successful, alumni are also enhancing the value of their own degree qualification. 
                        Typically, institutions will have researched the potential benefits of development and fundraising activities. They may have commissioned a formal

                    <p>                 By engaging alumni, an institution can continue to benefit from their skills and experience
                        Alumni are often in the position to engage the expertise of the institution in their professional live.                 
                        University alumni associations understand that even after graduation, many students continue to feel connected to their university, or associate a part of their identity with the institution. That's why many alumni associations continue to offer former students ways to keep their connection with the university.  Why is it Important for Alumni to Give Back?
                        An essential part of being an alumnus is finding ways to give back to the university. Many believe that it's giving donations to the school or responding to emails, but there is much more behind that. Those small acts of showing support for the community you have become a part of can be the beginning of a success story for new students. Give back
                        But remember that your university provided you with numerous educational opportunities and that your alumni association isn't just about discounts and job offers. Whether you know it or not, your school's alumni association was probably instrumental in your success, and while most universities hope that their students' successes post-graduation will promote the school's reputation and encourage others to consider matriculation, one of the main purposes of alumni associations is to recruit new students.
                        
                        Plus, alumni associations are great resources for incoming students – many award scholarships (funded by donations from alumni) and the strength of a school's alumni association can be a deciding factor for incoming students. And alumni associations aren't just for domestic students. Many universities with aspiring international programs depend on their alumni to spread the word, and alumni recommendations carry a lot of weight with prospective students. So whether you sign up for membership, send a generous donation, or offer to serve as a mentor, there are many ways that your alumni association will help you help your school.</p>

                        <p>        Graduating and receiving your diploma with that great sense of pride does not mean your time with the university has to be over. Getting involved in your alumni association can provide connections, career services, an alumni network, a wealth of knowledge and the opportunity to help the students who come after you.
        
                            Being an alumnus and receiving all the perks that come along with it is a two-way street. Alumni participation is critical to building and maintaining a strong community within the university. 
                            A support network can be challenging to come by, but an alumni network can give you a sense of belonging. The people you meet, the relationships you build and knowledge you learn from an alumni network is an incredibly useful tool for expanding your horizons.
